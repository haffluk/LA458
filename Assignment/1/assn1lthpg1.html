  I really enjoy kayaking and being by the river. That is what has drawn my to hydrology. Last year I was able to study abroad in Costa Rica.<br>
	<br>What I hope to learn in this class is how to get through it. I know now that I will never be a coder and I really want to graduate so learning exactly what Dr. Seeger wants us to learn is what I want to get out of this class.<br>
